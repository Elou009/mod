vacuum_tube;Electric lamp;x;x;x;x;x;x
vacuum_tube_desc;An electronic tube (also known as a radio tube) is a device that works by flowing an electric current in a vacuum.As a result of thermionic emission (Edison effect), electrons leave the surface of the negatively charged cathode and move through the vacuum to the positively charged electrode (anode).Additional electrodes between the cathode and anode were added later, opening up the possibility of amplifying and switching signals.Vacuum tubes were essential for the production and commercialization of radios, telephones, televisions, radars, and early computers.;x;x;x;x;x;x

tulls_seed_drill_desc;Until now, farmers have planted seeds by hand, putting them in a bag and walking around the field, scattering them.They threw them with their hands into the plowed and harrowed soil.The problem with this method is that it did not produce an even distribution of seeds.This was a waste of seeds and, therefore, a large part of it was wasted.Jethro Tall invented a seeder that could be harnessed to a horse.It consisted of a wheeled vehicle containing a box filled with grain.There was a wheel-operated ratchet that sprayed the seed evenly along the planter's entire path.;x;x;x;x;x;x

telephone_switchboard;Automatic telephone exchange;x;x;x;x;x;x
telephone_switchboard_desc;A telephone exchange is a system of electrical components used to connect telephone calls.The first telephone switch was invented by the Hungarian Tivadar Puskas in 1877, when he worked for Thomas Edison.Primitive telephone exchanges for commercial use appeared in 1881 in the eastern United States and Western Europe.Telephone exchanges consisted of hundreds of switches, where a staff of operators manually connected telephone line subscribers.Elmon Brown Stroger patented the first toggle switch in 1891 that could automatically connect subscribers.;x;x;x;x;x;x

flintlock_rifle_armament;Flintlock small arms;x;x;x;x;x;x
flintlock_rifle_armament_desc;Introduced at the beginning of the 17th century, the flintlock weapon quickly supplanted older types of incendiary mechanisms such as the samopal or wheel lock.It is still in common use for over two centuries, during which time the piston was replaced and the magazine system was later added.Although the flintlock weapon went out of mass production, it continues to be popular among fans of gunpowder shooting.;x;x;x;x;x;x
post_napoleonic_army_doctrine;Post-Napoleonic military doctrine;x;x;x;x;x;x
post_napoleonic_army_doctrine_desc;The French Revolution and theNapoleonic Wars also sparked a revolution in military strategy.The influence of this period was felt both in the American Civil War and in the early stages of the First World War.With the advent of cheap small arms and high population growth, the army grew rapidly in size, leading to a change in its structure.It was necessary to divide the army, first into divisions, and then into corps.Along with infantry units, divisional artillery also appeared - light, mobile guns with a firing range and power.A rigid formation of pickeners and musketeers, firing massive volleys, gave way to light infantry, who fought in small skirmishes.;x;x;x;x;x;x
muzzle_loaded_rifle_armament;Muzzle-loading small arms;x;x;x;x;x;x
muzzle_loaded_rifle_armament_desc;A muzzle-loading rifle is a weapon in which a projectile and a propellant charge are loaded from the muzzle, in contrast to breech-loading rifles.The first manual muzzle-loading weapon appeared in the 40s of the 15th century.The most famous muzzle-loading rifle was the Kentucky Rifle, which was actually created in Pennsylvania.This is an American rifle based on the German 'Jager'.;x;x;x;x;x;x
breech_loaded_rifle_armament;Breech-loading small arms;x;x;x;x;x;x
breech_loaded_rifle_armament_desc;A breech-loading weapon is a firearm in which a cartridge or projectile is loaded into a special chamber at the rear of the barrel.Despite the fact that breech-loading weapons were developed at the end of the 14th century, their widespread use began with the advent of precision engineering in the 19th century.;x;x;x;x;x;x
bolt_action_rifle_armament;Sliding shutter;x;x;x;x;x;x
bolt_action_rifle_armament_desc;Sliding bolt is a mechanism of small arms firearms that provide opening and closing of the barrel bore by rectilinear translational movement of the bolt along the axis of the barrel.It was first used in 1824 by JohannNikolaus von Dreise in the rifle of the same name.European armies continued to improve this mechanism until the end of the 19th century, and in 1898 the Mauser Rifle appeared, one of the most successful and perfect systems of such weapons.;x;x;x;x;x;x
machine_gun_armament;Machine gun armament;x;x;x;x;x;x
machine_gun_armament_desc;The Gatling Cannon, patented in 1861 by Richard Jordan Gatling, was the first weapon to produce controlled sequential fire with automatic loading.However, during the American Civil War, this weapon had serious shortcomings, and it was subsequently improved and widely used in the Franco-Prussian War and theNorthwest Revolt.This weapon was actively used until the beginning of the 20th century.The first self-powered machine gun was the Maxim Machine Gun, invented in 1885 by Sir Hiram Maxim.It used the recoil energy of the weapon, which had not been used in any way, allowing it to significantly increase the rate of fire than was possible in earlier designs.;x;x;x;x;x;x
cuirassier_activation;Cuirassiers;x;x;x;x;x;x
cuirassier_activation_desc;Cuirassiers - mounted troops, equipped with armor and weapons, first appeared at the end of the 15th century in Europe.The first cuirassiers were well protected and used a firearm as their primary weapon.They gained great importance during theNapoleonic wars, and were last used at the initial stages of the First World War.Now cuirassiers are an integral part of solemn military parades in many countries of the world.;x;x;x;x;x;x
dragoon_activation;Dragoons;x;x;x;x;x;x
dragoon_activation_desc;The word dragoon was originally called the mounted infantry - soldiers who were trained in both horse riding and infantry skills.However, the use of the term changed over the course of the 18th century and dragoons evolved into regular light cavalry.Dragoon regiments were created in most European armies in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.;x;x;x;x;x;x
hussar_activation;Hussars;x;x;x;x;x;x
hussar_activation_desc;Hussars belong to one of the types of light cavalry that originated in Hungary in the 15th century.The name and unusual shape of these riders later became widespread in European and other cavalry regiments.Hussars played a prominent role as cavalry in theNapoleonic Wars.Since they are cavalrymen on fast horses, they can be used for lightning attacks and for reconnaissance.;x;x;x;x;x;x
military_aviation;Military aviation;x;x;x;x;x;x
military_aviation_desc;Military aviation is the use of aircraft and other aircraft in warfare.The feasibility of using heavier than air aircraft became apparent immediately after their appearance.The Wright model was acquired in 1909 for the US Army, and in 1911 the Italians used various types of aircraft for reconnaissance, photo reconnaissance and bombardment of targets as part of the Italo-Turkish War.During the First World War, military aviation received a powerful impetus in development, many specialized types of aircraft appeared, such as reconnaissance aircraft, fighters and bombers.;x;x;x;x;x;x

tut_2a_1;Industry;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2a_2;Welcome to the 'Victoria II' tutorial scenario.In this section, you will learn about the industry in the game, as well as get acquainted with the most important component of country management - the economy.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2a_2a;The economy is built on money and goods.The population produces goods and consumes them.The armed forces also need goods.Money is needed to ensure the transition of goods from producers to consumers.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2a_2b;To view data on the production of goods in your country, click the production button on the top bar.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2a_2c;Production;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2a_2d;The movement of goods, from wood to small arms, is one of the most important elements of the game.Producers produce goods and consumers buy them.Ordinary people need general consumer goods, and producers need raw materials.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2a_2e;Basically, the movement of goods occurs without your participation.You interfere with this process by building factories, taxing sales income, and buying goods to supply your troops.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2a_2f;Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2a_3;Production;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2a_4;There are three sources of production of goods.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2a_4b;DP (extractive industry).These are farms and mines where peasants and workers extract the gifts of nature.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2a_4c;Handicraftsmen.These are blacksmiths and weavers.They buy raw materials from the market and process them into goods.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2a_4d;Factories.Factories also produce goods, and this is the way to the future.The factories, depending on the political system, are built by the player himself or the capitalists.They are employed by artisans and employees.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2a_5;Production screen;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2a_6;Here you can see all the goods that your country produces.They are categorized.\nNext to each product, there is an icon that shows who produces it:;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2a_6a;Peasants / workers at DP.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2a_6b;Craftsmen in factories.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2a_6c;Handicraftsmen working on their own.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2a_6d;Here you can hover over the icons for a complete view of the production in your country.This will help you make the right decisions.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;

##### Budget;;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
######################################################################;;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_1;Budget;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_2;To be successful on the global stage, your country (in this case Belgium) must have a balanced government budget.Expenses and investments should not exceed tax revenues.To manage your budget, you need to open the budget screen.Click on the corresponding button on the top panel.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_3;Budget screen;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_4;This is the budget screen.This is where you manage your government's expenses and revenues and can borrow money if you need money urgently.Let's start with taxation.ClickNext to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_5;Tax;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_6;Taxation is the most important source of income for the budget.Different taxes can be set for each segment of society.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_6a;There are three strata of society:;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_6b;Poor;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_6c;Middle class;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_6d;Rich;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_6e;Employees of different professions belong to different strata of society.You can see this by the icons next to each tax slider.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_6f;The taxes for each stratum are set using the corresponding slider.But taxation has its consequences: the more taxes, the less money remains with the population.Next to the slider, you see a pie chart.It shows how the needs of this segment of the population are being met.\nTry to establish minimum taxes that will allow you to have a positive budget balance.Then click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_7;Expenses;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_8;What do we do with taxes? First of all, we pay government expenses from them.There are other expenses, such as the military budget and the education budget, as well as the costs of maintaining your troops and colonies.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_9;There are two types of expenses.The first is the fixed cost of the goods you buy (for example, to supply the army).They depend on the actions that you take in other sections of the game - say, disbanding military units.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_10;The second type of expenses are those that can be changed through the budget using the sliders.The more to the right the slider, the higher your costs.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_11;In most cases, you will have to choose.Need more troops? Increase your military budget.Do you need a powerful bureaucracy? Move the administrative cost slider.\nTry moving the sliders and notice how the numbers change.Remember that all changes are gradual.If you increase the administrative costs, over time, more people will want to become officials.\nThen clickNext.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_18;Balance your budget;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_19;Belgium needs a balanced budget.To do this, you need to equalize expenses and income.However, any change has a downside.High taxes will not make people happy, and low taxes will worsen the state's financial situation.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_19a;If your budget is out of balance and you don't have enough money, you automatically take out a loan.Now let's try to balance your budget.When you are happy with the result, clickNext.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_20;Loans;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_21;If your economy needs a short-term infusion of funds, you can take out a loan.This is the money of that part of the population whose incomes exceed expenses.They are in the national bank.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_21a;When you borrow money, you first take the free funds of your population, and only then - the population of other countries.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
REMOVE_tut_3a_21b;Try to take a loan, bringing the slider to the desired number, and click 'Next'.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_22;Loans;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3a_23;Now you have taken out a loan.Your total debt has increased by the loan amount.Pay attention to the amount of interest: this is how much you will pay per day for using the loan.\nPaying interest on loans is burdensome, so let's pay off our debts.Press the loan repayment button and slide the slider all the way to the right, and then press OK.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;

tut_4a_3;Technology screen;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4a_4;This is where you can start exploring your technology.They are divided into five groups: army, navy, commerce, culture, and industry.Belgium is a promising industrial country, so let's click on the industry button.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;

tut_5a_2a;Political parties and reforms have a big impact on your ability to rule a country.You decide how to respond to the demands of the people.\nTo learn more about politics, click the corresponding button on the top panel.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5a_3;Policy screen;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5a_4;On this screen, you can find out which party is ruling in your country, as well as find out the political predilections of the people and voters and what issues they care about.If the system of government allows it, you can change the ruling party or call elections.Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5a_5;Government;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5a_6;The ruling party in your country is listed here.She has a certain ideology and a number of political preferences.The policies it pursues determine the capabilities of your country.For example, it depends on it who can build factories - the player or the capitalists.In addition, you can restrict the movement of the sliders on the budget screen.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5a_6a;Belgium is ruled by the Cathedral Party.By hovering over any game, you can learn more about it.As the game progresses, the ideological biases of your population and the issues important to it will change, and when appointing a government, you will have to take into account not only your desires, but also the desires of the people.Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5a_7;Reforms;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5a_8;You can change the face of your country through a series of political and social reforms.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5a_9;Political reforms affect the political system of the country, while social reforms redistribute budget funds in favor of certain groups of the population.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5a_10;You can listen to the opinion of the population on the issue of reforms, but you need to be sure that the country will withstand them.It is necessary to take into account the opinion of the upper house of parliament, which may oppose their implementation.\nThe following are examples of reforms that have already been made in Belgium:;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5a_11;Electoral system.Property qualification is in force in Belgium.This means that only the rich and middle class enjoy voting rights.If you go, for example, to weighted secured suffrage, the voter list will not change, but every vote of the rich counts as two.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5a_11a;Healthcare.Belgium has a minimum level of health care.This means that population growth can be increased by a maximum of 2.5% - only if social reforms are fully funded from the budget.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5a_12;Questions and voters;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5a_13;Here you can see what people think about the problems in your country.Pay attention to two pie charts: the ideology of the voters and the ideology of the population.The difference between them arises from our electoral system, the change of which refers to political reforms.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5a_13a;As a result, it is possible that the party will receive the majority of votes in the elections and win, but the people will be dissatisfied.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5a_13b;Below you see the most important issues of concern to the people and voters.It is important to take them into account when carrying out reforms.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;

######################################################################;;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_1;People;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_2;Your people are the main value, almost everything in the game depends on them.People produce goods and buy some of them, pay taxes, vote and revolt if they are not happy.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_2a;The main source of information about the people is the population screen.But first, let's talk about where the people live - about the provinces and regions.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_2b;Click on the province of Brussels in the center of the map.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_3;Province and region.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_4;The entire map is divided into provinces - the smallest geographic units in the game.Your subjects live and work in them.\nIn turn, provinces are made up of regions.An area can have from one to four or more provinces.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_4a;The region contains everything that is common to all its provinces.These are factories where goods are produced, officials who collect taxes, and capitalists and nobles who exploit workers.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_4b;At the top of the province screen, you see the province's name (Flanders), and below it the province's name.\nIn Victoria II, almost everything that happens to your subjects depends on your actions, however, this is an indirect dependency.There is one way to directly influence the state of affairs in a province: national priority.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_5;To access it, click on the national priority icon on the province screen.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_6;National priority;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_7;National Priority is one of the most powerful ways to influence your population through indirect effects at the area level.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_8;Railways - You can push your capitalists to build railways.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_9;Immigration - You can encourage your citizens to relocate to this province.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_10;Colonization - You can create a colony in this area.This is the only effort available in the empty area.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_11;Status upgrade - you can push the population to upgrade their status by acquiring a certain profession.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_12;Manufacturing - You can encourage capitalists and artisans to produce certain goods.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
REMOVE_tut_6a_13;To increase industrial production in Belgium, we need more industrial workers.Click on the worker icon to set this priority.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_14;People;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_15;On the province screen, you can also view population statistics.Three pie charts (from left to right) show their work, ideology and culture.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_15a;For more details, click the browse villager statistics button next to the chart.Do it.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_16;Overview of residents.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_17;This is the villagers' screen.Here you can find all the information about the population of Belgium.If you entered here through the province of Brussels, that province will be represented first.Let's take a closer look at the composition of the population of Brussels.You can also select another province, province, or state as a whole.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_18;At the top of the screen are a series of buttons that allow you to filter out populations with specific occupations.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_19;Here you can also get detailed information about the selected group: who works where, what is the population's religion and culture.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_20;There is also a long list of the province's population, divided into units with a common profession, culture and religion.These are the so-called residents.Let's take a closer look at them.Find a Flemish artisan in the list and click on his icon.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_21;Group of residents;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6a_22;A group of residents is the main unit of the population, a group of people with a common profession, culture and religion.On this screen, you can see how the population views important issues, as well as the degree of their dissatisfaction.We encourage you to drop by here to see how different populations are reacting to your policies.They may try to change jobs, emigrate or revolt.\nClickNext to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;

##### Trade ;;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
######################################################################;;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7a_1;Trade;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7a_2;In Victoria II, goods are produced in a variety of ways: in DPs, factories and artisans.Goods are sold for money.Most of this trade between residents and factories is automatic.Something is done by the player himself, for example, purchases goods to create and supply armies, build factories and support overseas possessions.All these processes are managed on the trading screen.Click the trade button on the top bar.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7a_3;Trade screen;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7a_4;This is a trading screen, where you will find a lot of information about the movement of goods in the market.\n At the top right, there is a list of all available goods with an indication of the price and its last fluctuations.We need information about small arms.Click on the appropriate icon.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7a_5;Goods;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7a_6;Pay attention to the changed square in the upper right corner.It contains detailed information about the product.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7a_6a;Above, you see a chart showing price changes.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
REMOVE_tut_7a_6b;Below there are two lines with a checkmark: 'Automation' and 'Buy'.\nThe first one sets the automatic purchase of goods necessary for your armies.\nThe second restricts your orders only to goods produced in your country.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7a_6c;It also shows how much your country is producing and the needs of the government, your people, and the producers in your country.Now let's buy something.Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7a_7;Transactions;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7a_8;The Dutch are a threat to us, so we need to stock up on weapons.It is necessary to create armies and supply them in the future.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
REMOVE_tut_7a_8a;Notice the Buy icon below it and the slider beside it.If you set the slider to a certain amount of stock, the game will automatically try to purchase this product until the stock reaches the desired value.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7a_8b;On the other hand, if you click on the icon above Buy, it changes to Sell and you start selling off your stock until it reaches the set value.We're going to buy now.Make sure the icon is set to buy, bring the slider to ten, and click Confirm Trade.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
#tut_7a_10;Domestic market;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
#tut_7a_11;Before we continue, let's say a few words about the markets.In Victoria II, the world is divided into your common domestic market and the global market.The internal market is everything that is produced in your country and in the countries within your sphere of influence.When your government or residents buy something, they first try to buy it on the domestic market, and only then on the world market.Everything that is not sold on the domestic market will go to the world market, and other countries will be able to buy it.Look in the lower right corner of what is produced on your home market and click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7a_12;Your stocks;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7a_13;Now take a look at stocks.This shows how much of each item is in your government's inventory, as well as changes per day.Pay attention to the button allowing purchases from stock.If you check it, then buyers from the domestic market will be able to buy goods from your inventory.This can come in handy in times of war, when you cannot buy goods overseas, but you have a strategic supply.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7a_15;Now turn off the pause for a few days and watch as your stocks of small arms arrive.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;

##### Diplomacy ;;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
######################################################################;;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8a_1;Diplomacy;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8a_2;Diplomacy in Victoria II is an essential tool for world domination.On this screen, you make alliances and declare wars.You draw small countries into your sphere of influence and monitor your position among the great powers.\nClick the diplomacy button on the top bar.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8a_3;Diplomacy screen;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8a_3a;This is the diplomacy screen.Here you make diplomatic decisions for your country and follow the actions of other countries.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8a_3b;First, we need to do something against our enemies from the north.But theNetherlands is a little stronger than us, and we need allies.Britain is well suited for this role.Try to find it in the list of countries at the bottom left.You can use the filter buttons above the list.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8a_4a;Country information;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8a_4b;We chose the United Kingdom.Before entering into an alliance with them, we need to find out how they treat us.Look at the relationship level to the right of the selected country.It's not too high, but you can try.Now let's check if they are currently involved in other conflicts.Click the Contingent Wars button at the top.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8a_5;Country information;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8a_6;Here, on this screen, we can see all the wars being waged.This is now just a Texas-Mexico war.In addition, you can view the list of allies and wars of the United Kingdom in the middle right, as well as get some data on its military capabilities.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
REMOVE_tut_8a_7;To try to forge an alliance with the United Kingdom, we must undertake diplomatic action.Diplomatic actions are very different - from an alliance proposal to a declaration of war.To take the action, we must have diplomacy points, they are accrued every month.On the top panel, we see that we have 1 point.Just so much is required to conclude an alliance.Press the Alliance button, then confirm your decision to enter into an alliance with Britain.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8a_8;Declaration of war;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8a_9;The United Kingdom is now our ally.Usually you have to wait a while, but this time the Foreign Office was in a hurry.Now let's deal with the Dutch.Select theNetherlands from the list and click the 'Declare War' button.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8a_10;Declaration of war;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8a_11;When you declare war, you must define its purpose.This is the official reason for entering the war, and when making peace, our demands are limited to the stated goals of the war.If the war goes well for us, we can add new targets.But if we fail to achieve them, our population will be outraged.\nNow we just want to humiliate the Dutch.This means that if we win, we can slightly lower their prestige.Click the Humiliation button.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8a_12;Declaration of war;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8a_13;Declaring war comes at a cost.This price is a reputation in the eyes of the rest of the world.A high dishonor score can create a lot of problems.For example, other states can form coalitions to stop a militant nation.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8a_14;War also brings trophies.In addition to the reward for achieving the goals of the war (on this screen you can see that in case of victory we will lower the prestige of the Dutch), you also earn prestige.Depending on the chosen goals, it will be more or less.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8a_15;Each goal of the war also has a corresponding price of peace.The higher this price, the more military successes you will have to achieve in order for your enemy to admit defeat.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8a_16;We are now ready to declare war.Click the 'Accept' button in the declaration of war window.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;

tut_1b_1;Military Science - Intermediate;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1b_2;In this part, we'll walk you through the basics of the Victoria II military system.Those who played the first Victoria are familiar with them, but others will find it useful.\nLet's start with the military power screen.Please click the corresponding button on the top bar.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1b_3;Military screen;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1b_4;This is a military screen.Here you can observe your military forces and commanders, as well as create new units and mobilize in case of war.\nWe will start with the process of recruiting armies in Victoria II.Click the create army button.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1b_5;Human resources and population;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1b_6;The human resources in Victoria are quite different from other Paradox games.Here, all troops are part of the population, they are residents whose profession is soldiers.\nTo create an army, you must have enough soldiers among your population who are ready to join the ranks of your troops.The list contains all the parts that you can now type.If you need more, then you have to push more people to become soldiers.To do this, you need to increase the military budget through the budget screen.\nNow click on the Walloon infantry.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1b_7;Troop cost in goods;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1b_8;The part you clicked on is called the Walloon Infantry.This means that it is a regular infantry, recruited from Walloon soldiers.Also note that the province of Brussels is shown next to the unit name.The soldiers of this unit live in this province.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1b_9;Now look at the icons and numbers to the left of the title of the part.These are the goods that are needed to create it.This particular piece requires 10 small arms and 10 canned food.They will be taken from your stocks, and if there are not enough of them, they will automatically be bought on the world market.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1b_10;The piece we want to create has now appeared in the build queue on the right side of the screen.To stop building it, just click on it, but now we don't need it.Click the 'Close' button to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1b_11;Generals and admirals;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1b_12;To win battles, your troops need the right command.To recruit generals and admirals, we need leadership points.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1b_13;Leadership points are created by citizen officers.If you need more generals, increase the military budget in the budget window in the same way as if you need soldiers.The difference is that the soldiers are recruited from the poor, while the officers are from the rich.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1b_14;Pay attention to the number on the button for creating a general.This is the number of generals for whom you have enough leadership points.Click this button.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1b_15;General;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1b_16;We now have the first general.As you can see, it has two main properties, good or bad.Hover over them to see what effect they have on the troops.Even a bad military leader is better than none.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1b_17;You can also see which army this general is in command.Our new general, of course, is still in reserve.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1b_18;You can automatically recruit and assign generals if you check the box next to the corresponding line.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
REMOVE_tut_1b_19;We will now manually assign the general to the position.Close the war screen and select a division in the Spa.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1b_20;Appointment of a Warlord;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1b_21;To assign a commander, click on the text '(No commander)' in the unit window, and then select the general from the list that appears.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;

##### Production Medium;;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
######################################################################;;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2b_1;Manufacturing - Medium;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2b_2;In this part, we'll walk you through the basics of production in Victoria II.Those who played the first 'Victoria' are already familiar with them.\nLet's start by talking about the main producers of resources - mining enterprises (DP).Click on the province of Brussels to open the province screen.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2b_3;DP;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2b_4;Some of the goods are produced by DP.These are mainly farms and mines.In the center of the province screen, you see data for the DP of Brussels, a sulfur mine.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2b_5;Output.The icons show us that this DP is producing sulfur.The number next to it indicates the product units.Hover your cursor over production to see the factors that affect product output.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2b_6;Income.Everything that DP produces goes to the market.If the product is sold, the DP earns income.From the income are payments to workers and noble owners of the DP.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2b_7;Employees.DP needs labor: farms need peasants and mines need workers.The more workers you have, the more you produce, but the number of workers you can hire per enterprise is limited.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2b_8;You cannot directly influence the performance of your DPs, but you can invent new technology that will increase production efficiency, build railways, change taxes, or implement reforms to make working on farms or mines more (or less) attractive.\nHouse the cursor on icons for details.Then click the production button on the top bar.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2b_9;Factories;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2b_10;Plants are being built in the regions.On this screen, you can see all the working factories in your country.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2b_11;Source materials.To produce their own products, factories need to purchase raw materials for them on the world market.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2b_12;Content.In addition to the regular costs of purchasing raw materials, factories also need to buy cement.If the plant does not receive the required amount of cement, production drops.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2b_13;If your factories are competing for the same resources, you can prioritize one of them.Several of our factories require iron.Increase the priority of the steel mill and it will receive iron first.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2b_14;Construction of factories;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2b_16;Construction of factories;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2b_17;This screen shows all the factories that you can build.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2b_18;If you click on a casual wear factory in the menu, you can see what raw materials it needs.We already have a textile factory in our country, so building a factory that needs textiles as raw materials will be a boon for the local economy.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2b_19;Below you can see the factory's production costs.To build a factory, you must provide it with raw materials.If you do not have them at the time of the start of construction, then they will be automatically purchased on the world market.The raw materials will keep the factory running for the first few days.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2b_20;You can also see the number of unemployed workers on this screen.If there are none, you can still build a factory.And other workers will start to become factory workers.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2b_21;Supply and demand for goods is a good indicator of the need for a particular type of enterprise, especially if there is local production of raw materials and demand for finished goods.\nNow, let's build a casual clothing factory.Click the appropriate button.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2b_22;Factory modernization;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2b_23;You don't need to build new factories to increase production.You can upgrade them.Depending on the political system, this can be done by the capitalists or the player himself.The cost of modernization, as well as the construction of a new plant, can be found by hovering the cursor over the corresponding button.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;

tut_2b_25;Factory income;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2b_26;Everything that the factories produce goes to the world market.After the sale, the plant receives an amount of money, which depends on the type of product and its current price.Then part of the money is set aside for the purchase of raw materials the next day, and the remainder is income.From it money is paid to workers (artisans and employees) and factory owners (capitalists).The player does not receive money directly from the income of the factories.The budget revenues come from taxes from the population and duties on goods.\nDo not forget to monitor the profitability of your factories.Unprofitable factories will lay off workers, leading to unemployment.\nClickNext to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;

tut_3b_1;Budget - Medium;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3b_2;In this part of the scenario, we'll take a look at the role of the budget in Victoria II.The budget system here is significantly different from other games from Paradox.First, let's open the budget screen.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3b_3;Taxation of the population;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3b_4;In Victoria II taxes are levied on the income of the population.Every time a resident of a country receives income, you get some part of it.Your population is divided into the following layers:;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3b_5;The poor are workers and peasants.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3b_6;The middle class is artisans, clergy and other educated people.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3b_7;The rich are the upper classes, aristocrats and capitalists.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3b_8;The pie charts next to each layer show how this population is doing and whether it is getting what it needs.If you see a lot of red, then you can try to fix the situation by lowering taxes.You can also hover over the icon for a specific population group to see how they are doing.Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3b_9;Duties;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3b_10;Duties are special taxes or subsidies on international trade.If you move the slider to the right, you will increase the price of goods that your businesses and people buy abroad.If you move it to the left, then, on the contrary, you will subsidize such transactions.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3b_11;The benefits of duties are twofold - they generate income and force consumers to buy domestically produced goods.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3b_12;Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3b_13;Main types of expenses;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3b_14;Now let's take a look at the main types of expenses.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3b_15;Industry subsidies.With these funds, you finance factories that do not generate profits.You can assign a subsidy on the production screen.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3b_16;State reserves.This is the price of the daily trades made on the trade screen.Below you see two numbers - these are the cost of goods needed to maintain your army and overseas possessions.These numbers do not directly affect government inventory spending because you need to replenish used inventory with goods.These deals can be entered into manually, or it happens automatically when you build a factory or maintain an army that needs to be supplied.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3b_17;Education.These funds are paid to the clergy, which teaches the inhabitants and somewhat reduces the consciousness of the population.The higher the slider is set, the more attractive the position of the clergy.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3b_18;Control.These funds go to the salaries of your officials.They carry out social reforms and collect taxes.The more officials there are in the state, the more efficient tax collection is.Above the slider, you see the average control efficiency.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3b_19;Social expenses.These funds finance social reforms and pay unemployment benefits and pensions.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3b_20;Defense spending.This is the salary of soldiers and officers.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3b_21;All these expenses go directly to various groups of citizens.If you pay them too little, they will start thinking about changing their profession.If you pay a lot, other residents will learn this profession and your expenses will increase even more.It is necessary to find a balance to get the optimal number of employees in each sector.\nClick 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3b_22;Diplomatic balance;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3b_23;Money can also enter the budget and leave it as a result of diplomatic actions.This includes military subsidies we receive from or pay to friends, war reparations, etc.\nClickNext to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4b_1;Technology - Intermediate;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4b_2;In this section, we will look at how research is conducted and how it affects your country.\nLet's open the technology screen with the appropriate button on the top panel.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4b_3;Generating Research Points;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4b_4;Each technology researchable has a cost, expressed in research points.This is the number of points that you must create to complete the development of the technology.If you click on any technology, you will see this price in the upper right corner of the help window.\nClickNext to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4b_5;Generating Research Points;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4b_6;Research points are created by your population - clergy and employees.The number of points depends on their education level.Moreover, it depends on pluralism and technological progress.Hover over the technology button on the top bar and see how many Research Points Belgium generates.Further we will talk about what technology affects.Click on the strategic mobility technology in the army section.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4b_7;Research results of technologies and inventions;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4b_8;The discovery of technology has a double effect: immediate effect and invention.If you look at the help window, you will see that strategic mobility affects the level of fortresses, army reconnaissance and army consumption of supplies.This effect occurs immediately after learning the technology.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4b_9;Inventions.Notice the light bulbs next to technology, they represent inventions.If you hover over them, you can see their effects.The effects of inventions do not appear immediately: it is rather a chance that the invention will be accidentally made after learning the corresponding technology.The color of the light indicates whether the technology has already been discovered.Gray means that it cannot be opened, yellow means that it can, and green means that it is already open.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4b_10;See which inventions depend on which technologies, then clickNext.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5b_1;Politics;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5b_2;In this chapter, you will be introduced to some of the basic concepts of the Victoria II political system.Click the policy button on the top bar.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5b_3;Ruling party;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5b_4;Here you can see which party is ruling in Belgium.Now it is the Cathedral Party.Her policies have a huge impact on your country and limit your freedom of political decision.Under the name of the party, you can see its current policy.For example, nationalists have a policy of state capitalism, so you can build factories yourself.Under a different policy, only capitalists can do this.An important effect of the policy is to limit the budget runners.For example, the party of state capitalism will not allow tax cuts below a certain level.Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5b_5;Form of government;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5b_6;If you do not like the government in power, then your ability to change something depends on the form of government.It also limits the ideologies with which one can come to power.Belgium has royal rule.Under this system, elections are held, but the player can neglect their results in favor of another party.True, in this case, the aggressiveness of the adherents of the offended side will increase.\nThe player cannot directly change the form of government, but it can change if the reforms carried out by the player are incompatible with the previous form of government.For example, a democratic form of government cannot exist without elections.Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5b_7;Elections;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5b_8;In some forms of government, the ruling party is determined by the outcome of the elections.This is true for royalty or democracy.In a democracy, elections must take place at regular intervals, but early elections can be held by pressing the appropriate button.\nAfter the elections are announced, the election campaign begins.Its outcome can be influenced by various events (for example, scandals and fiery speeches).At the end of the campaign, voters decide which party should rule, focusing on its position on issues important to them.Remember that voters are not necessarily the entire nation.For example, in Belgium, only the rich have the right to vote.Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5b_9;Political reforms;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5b_10;Political reforms affect the political system of the country and the attitude of the people towards politics.For example, voting rights and the electoral system affect who votes and how their votes are scored.Press rights affect how the political bias of the literate population changes.Political reforms are usually driven by the demands of the people, but you can also reform if you want more freedom in determining the course your country will take.Now let's move on to social reforms.Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5b_11;Social reforms;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5b_12;Social reforms affect the well-being of your people.Some of them affect the productivity of industry (for example, limiting working hours), while others reallocate budget funds in favor of certain groups of the population.Some social reforms can bring great benefits.Do not forget, however, that implementing reforms will increase your administrative costs.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5b_13;Solutions;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5b_14;In the lower right corner of the policy screen, you will find solutions.They have important implications for your country.It could be a change in academia, the construction of the Panama Canal, or the unification of Germany under your rule.If you hover your cursor over the question mark, you will see the prerequisites for making a decision.If you hover over a checkmark, you will see its consequences.If the check mark is gray, then you cannot make this decision: you do not have the necessary prerequisites.Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5b_15;Rebel factions;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5b_16;If you ignore the troubles of your people, you will eventually have rebel factions.With the growing aggressiveness of the population, residents will begin to think about joining the rebel faction.This transition will be shown on this screen.Such a faction consists of dissatisfied people with common reasons for dissatisfaction.As you can see, there is a reactionary faction in Belgium.There are three numbers to the right of its name.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5b_17;Number of members.This is the number of people supporting the faction.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5b_18;Organization.This is the percentage that shows the influence of the faction.If the rich are unhappy, this percentage will be higher.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5b_19;Insurrection.This is the risk of a general uprising by this faction.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5b_20;If a faction revolts, it will form several rebel armies.Their strength will depend on the number of members and organization.Do not forget: if the aggressiveness of a certain group of residents becomes too high, he will rebel even without the support of his faction, and this can increase the risk of a general uprising.To get rid of a faction, you must defeat it on the battlefield or resolve issues troubling aggressive residents.To find out more about the desires of the residents, go to the population screen.Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6b_1;People;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6b_2;In this section, we will tell you a little more about who groups of residents are and how they are guided in their actions.Click the population button on the top bar.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6b_3;Group of residents;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6b_4;The basic unit of population in 'Victoria II' is the group of residents.She represents a group of people who live in the same province and share a common profession, culture and religion.Each resident has a number of signs that we will now consider.Click on any group icon to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6b_5;Group of residents;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6b_6;Here you can see detailed information about these representatives of the people.Here are their main features.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6b_7;Language and culture of the group.Some treat minorities badly and this can lead to conflicts.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6b_8;Aggressiveness indicator of the population.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6b_9;An indicator of the extent to which the population is aware of its interests.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6b_10;Education, which determines the number of research points, the effectiveness of the work of artisans, the attitude of residents to politics, etc.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6b_11;Religion.If it differs from the religion of the country, it can lead to conflicts.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6b_12;Unemployment.Shows how busy a group of residents is with work.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6b_13;Satisfaction of needs.Shows how satisfied the needs of residents in goods.Without luxury, the inhabitant is less happy, without basic necessities, hunger begins.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
REMOVE_tut_6b_14;Now close this popup and continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6b_15;Aggressiveness and conscientiousness;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6b_16;Let's talk a little about these critical signs.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6b_17;Consciousness.The main effect of conscientiousness is the desire for reform.As the game progresses, peoples develop, their consciousness grows, and residents begin to demand reforms.If they receive them, their consciousness drops a little.Another important effect of consciousness is the growth of the needs of a group of residents.This means that a wealthy dictatorship can avoid reform by improving the welfare of its people.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6b_18;Aggressiveness.If the needs of a group of residents are not met, they become angry.The more aggressive it is, the higher the risk of rebellion.When a certain level of aggressiveness is reached, a group of residents will join the rebel faction and begin to use their capabilities to overthrow the government, rebel and create a rebel army.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;

tut_6b_20;Cash;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6b_21;Finally, the residents have money.They earn it by their labor on the farm or in the factory.Then, with this money, they satisfy their needs.If residents have extra money, they can put it in a state bank, where they will be available for lending to the state.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7b_1;Trade;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7b_2;In this section we will talk about the basics of trading in Victoria II.Open the trading screen by clicking on the corresponding button on the top panel.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7b_3;World market;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7b_4;In Victoria II, all manufactured goods go to the world market.Every day, all residents, factories and governments try to buy what they need for life and work, and they come to the market for it.Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7b_5;Prices;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
REMOVE_tut_7b_6;Every day the world market sets uniform prices as a function of supply and demand.The current supply and demand determine the target price, towards which the actual price will gradually tend.You should watch for changes in the prices of the goods that you need.If small arms are rising in value, then it might make sense to build a new factory.Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7b_7;Government purchases and sales;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7b_9;Government Procurement - Automatic Transactions;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7b_10;Some deals are closed automatically.These are deals for goods necessary for the maintenance of fleets, armies and overseas possessions, as well as for construction.Please note that there is a check mark here.It shows that this transaction occurs automatically.Let's try to make a deal manually.Uncheck the box.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7b_11;Government Procurement - Manual Transactions;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7b_12;Closing deals manually can be useful when you want to build inventory or adjust the pace of purchasing items.To manually give an order to sell, set the required value with the slider.This means that if you have more goods than the slider has set, you will start selling it.To confirm the transaction, click the 'Confirm Trade' button.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7b_13;Import and export;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7b_14;The market in the game is divided into two parts: the domestic and the world market.The internal market includes everything that is produced in your country and in the countries within your sphere of influence.Everything that is not sold on the domestic market gets to the world market.If a buyer wants to buy something, he first tries to find a product on the domestic market.But if he could not buy everything he needed there, then he imports goods from the world market.You can develop your economy so that everything your country needs is produced locally.Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_1;Diplomacy;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_2;In this section, we will talk about statuses and the diplomatic interface.Click the diplomacy button on the top bar.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_3;Status;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_4;Status in Victoria II is of paramount importance.Upgrading your status will give you benefits and respect in the world.There are three types of statuses, together they give a general status.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_5;Prestige.The prestige grows with the rise of the status of the country: win wars, create colonies, develop culture.Prestige is very important, as it determines the order of procurement of goods on the world market.With the highest prestige, you will be the first to purchase goods on the global market.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_6;Industry.To increase this indicator, build factories and railways.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_7;Army.This is the size of your military.Large warships have the highest status gains.However, do not forget that after the appearance of a new type of ships, the old ones become practically useless.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_8;These three indicators determine your status and your place in the sun.Let's see where we are.Click on the # sign above the list of countries and arrange them by status.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_9;List of countries;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_10;As you can see, the most significant country in the world is the United Kingdom.Try to find our Belgium.She's not too high on the list.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_11;Country name and flag.Everything is clear here.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_12;A priority.This is where you set the priority order for the countries you want to influence.This is only available to great powers in relation to other states.Unfortunately, our status is not yet high enough.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_13;The influence of the great powers.Here you can see how strongly each of the eight great powers influences other countries.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_14;Sphere of influence.Here you can see if a country is within the sphere of influence of another country.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_15;Check.In order: prestige, industry, army and general rank of the country.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_16;Current opinion.All states, except the great powers themselves, have a certain opinion about them.This opinion ranges from hostile to friendly and determines the country's compliance to the demands of a great power.If a country is friendly and a great power has enough influence over it, then the great power can pull the country into its sphere of influence.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_17;Attitude.How good is your relationship with this country.You can improve this relationship, but in the long run this value will tend to zero.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_18;Click on Luxembourg, which is in the Dutch sphere of influence.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_19;Country Details -Not Great Powers;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_20;Here you see information about Luxembourg.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_21;Above you see that this is a civilized country and an absolute monarchy, and the country is ruled by a conservative faction.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_22;Here you will find her rank and score.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_23;Then information about the population and its culture.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_24;This shows the degree of influence that each great power has over Luxembourg.This will be very important when you become a great power yourself.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_25;Now find the United Kingdom in the list and click on it.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_26;Country Profile - Great Powers;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8b_27;As you can see, the United Kingdom is a great power.The greatest.The information about it is the same, with one exception: instead of the influence of other countries, you see a list of countries in its sphere of influence or close to it.Once you become a great power, it will be useful for you to know who your opponent is preparing to take over.\nClickNext to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1c_1;Military Science - Advanced;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1c_2;In this section, we'll talk about some of the Victoria II features that will be new to even experienced players in the first Victoria.Choose one of the Belgian armies.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1c_3;Communication of the army with the population;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1c_4;In Victoria II, each army you create requires one group of villagers (members of your population).This is the future personnel of the army.Note that there is a soldier icon next to all army regiments.It denotes the connection of the army with a certain group of the population belonging to the class of soldiers.Most of your armies are associated with such classes, except in the case of a general mobilization of the people.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1c_5;This connection in Victoria II is quite specific.If the army suffers losses, these losses are reflected in the group of residents with which it is associated.If the group revolts, then the units associated with it also revolt.You must not forget about this, especially when you mobilize a significant part of the population and send them to die in the trenches.Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1c_6;Supply;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1c_7;To conduct hostilities, your units need supplies - small arms and canned food for the armies and clipper convoys for the fleets.The government should buy all this from the market.By default, purchases are made automatically, but you can purchase supplies manually from the trade screen.Hover over the supply bar to see the needs of this army and how well they are being met.\nClickNext to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_1c_8;Uprisings;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
REMOVE_tut_1c_9;As we have already said, if a group of residents associated with a soldier raises an uprising, then the corresponding regiments begin to revolt along with it.One of your regiments is marked with a rebel faction icon.This means that its inhabitant belongs to this faction.This situation is very dangerous.You can find out the status of this group of residents and their concerns by clicking on the group icon in the unit window and opening the population screen.Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2c_1;Industry - Advanced;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2c_2;We now turn to a detailed description of the production of goods and the distribution of income.Click on the production button on the top bar.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2c_3;Handicraftsman;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2c_4;In Victoria II, goods are not only made in factories.In the production table, you can see all possible types of goods.Note that some of them have a handicraft icon next to them.This means that these goods are produced by artisans.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2c_5;Craftsmen are not employed in factories or DPs.They themselves buy the goods they need on the market and make other goods from them, which they then sell.They spend their income on the purchase of the next batch of raw materials and to meet their needs.\n Handicraftsmen are the main manufacturers of high-value goods at the beginning of the game, but during the game they will be replaced by factories that take advantage of new technologies.\n Click 'Next' to go to distribution of income.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2c_8;Income and its distribution;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2c_9;Like artisans, factories and DPs depend on the sale of their goods in the market.The difference between the amount of revenue and the cost of purchasing raw materials (DPs do not spend anything on this) is income, which is distributed as follows:;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2c_10;Owners.Aristocrats own DPs, and capitalists own factories.They give a small bonus to production, and in return receive a relatively large portion of the income.This part is distributed among all owners in the region in equal shares.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2c_11;Workers.These are peasants and workers in the DP and artisans and employees in factories.The workers of a particular plant or DP get the rest of the income (this is determined by the reform of the minimum wage), which they use to purchase the necessary goods.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2c_12;Sometimes the factory needs a little help from the player.ClickNext.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2c_13;Plant subsidies;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_2c_14;Sometimes it happens that a plant is operating at a loss, but you do not want to close it.Perhaps it produces strategically important products, or you do not want an increase in unemployment.Funds to cover plant losses are taken from your budget.Assign a subsidy to your clothing factory by ticking the appropriate box.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3c_1;Budget - Advanced;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3c_2;In this section, we'll go into more detail about the budget and look at the role of gold and government officials.Let's open the budget screen.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3c_3;Government spending is a source of livelihood for officials;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3c_4;Most of the sliders are for determining the amount of payments to various employees of your state.All money paid in this way is equally distributed among the residents of the corresponding type.Residents will do their job in the same way, regardless of the amount of payment.However, if you pay them too little, they will start changing professions and may even rebel.But if you pay them well, more people will strive to get jobs in this specialty.This means that if you need more soldiers or officials, you will have to increase the wages of this category of workers.But at the same time, keep an eye on the budget balance.Let's move on to civil servants.Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3c_5;Education;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3c_6;The clergy is paid from the education budget, it teaches the people to read and shapes their political views.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3c_7;Decreased consciousness.If there are clergy in the province, the consciousness of the locals will grow more slowly.This effect is more pronounced among the poor.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3c_8;The growth of education.If there are clergy in the province, the education of the locals will grow.When the clergy reaches three percent of the population, further increases have no effect.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;

tut_3c_10;Control;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3c_11;Payments to officials are made from the administrative budget, without which the modern state cannot function.A lot depends on them.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3c_12;Taxation.How much taxes do you actually receive by moving the slider on the tax scale.The more bureaucrats there are in your state, the more efficient tax collection becomes.However, one should not forget: the more money you take from the population, the less they have left for their immediate needs.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3c_13;For your officials to be of maximum benefit, you must maintain their optimal numbers.It is determined by the budget of the state administration, and also depends on how easily the population can find work.Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3c_14;Social sphere;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3c_15;Social spending is used to finance reforms.This money is paid not to civil servants, but to those groups of the population that benefit from the reforms.Unemployment benefits are received by unemployed residents, and pensions are distributed among the entire population.As you can see, these costs for Belgium are equal to zero, since we did not carry out any reforms.Now let's move on to gold.ClickNext.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3c_16;Gold;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3c_17;Precious metals are a special kind of goods.They are not traded on the world market because they immediately turn into money, which is distributed between those who work in the mine and the region where it is located.Note that this is the only way money will flow into the Victoria II economy.If world production does not grow, the inflow of gold will cause inflation.\nNow, let's take a closer look at the borrowing system.Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3c_18;Loans;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3c_19;As we have already said, the state can always borrow money from the world bank.The only way money can flow into the economy is through gold mining, so you need to explain where the money you are borrowing comes from.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3c_20;When residents earn money, they partly deposit it in a state bank.When a country needs a loan, this money is taken from different state banks: first in the country's bank, and then in foreign banks.The procedure for raising funds is determined by the size of the banks: the larger ones issue money first.If you have not taken out a loan yet, do so and click 'Next'.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3c_21;Loans;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3c_22;You see a list of countries in the loan table.These are the countries to which you owe money.When you pay interest or forcibly repay loans, this money is distributed among the residents of different countries who saved it.The order of distribution depends on the size of the fleets of these countries.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_3c_23;If you cannot pay the interest on the loans, then you will have to default.In this case, the creditor countries with the help of their fleets can force you to carry out certain economic policies that will allow you to pay off your debts.You should avoid the default as much as possible.\nClickNext to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5c_1;Politics;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5c_2;In this section, we describe the key principles of the Victoria II political system.Let's open the policy screen.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5c_3;Pluralism;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5c_4;Let's start with pluralism.It reflects the desire of society for reforms.The higher this value, the stronger the desire for reforms.Progressing populations give you certain benefits, such as increased research points.Pluralism will increase over time.Its growth rate depends on the progress of certain technologies and inventions.If you hover over the pluralism value, you will see the current growth rate for Belgium.\nClickNext to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5c_5;Revanchism;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5c_6;Revanchism reflects the irritation of the population with what it perceives as injustice from other states.For example, if you lose your ancestral territory, the level of revanchism will rise and remain high until you reclaim your land, or until enough time has passed for the people to forget their grievances.A high level of revanchism will push the population towards the ideologies of chauvinism and fascism.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5c_7;Upper House (Senate);X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5c_8;The upper house limits the scope for new social and political reforms.This possibility depends on the parties elected to the upper house.Different parties have different attitudes towards reforms.For example, the fascists will not support any reform unless a fascist party is ruling.Conservatives will consider the possibility of reform only if the aggressiveness of the country's inhabitants becomes very high.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5c_9;On the left, you can see how the current upper house of the Belgian parliament relates to reforms and what ideologies are represented in it.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5c_10;The composition of the upper house depends on the political reform of the upper house.Hover over the different options to see how different parties feel about changing existing rules.Then clickNext.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5c_11;The cost of social reforms;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_5c_12;We are carrying out social reforms to pacify the people and make their life easier.But these reforms come at a price.Most of these reforms increase the need for officials, with two exceptions.Unemployment benefits and pensions are paid directly to residents and enable them to survive.Pensions are paid to all residents and cover up to 20 percent of their living needs, while unemployment benefits are paid only to the unemployed.Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6c_1;People;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6c_2;Here we will talk about the movement of the population, its ideology and important issues for residents.First, let's open the population screen.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6c_3;Ideologies and questions;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6c_4;All residents are committed to a certain ideology, everyone is interested in their own questions.Over time, their addictions can change under the influence of two types of factors:;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6c_5;Current situation.How are things for a group of residents at the moment.If residents are unemployed, they dream of increasing unemployment benefits and so on.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6c_6;The type of group of residents.Different types of residents, even in the same situation, have different preferences.The soldiers are militant, the capitalists gravitate towards liberalism, and so on.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6c_7;Residents are gradually changing their attitude towards various issues.If a significant number of residents begin to change their views, it is worth reacting to it.You can satisfy their wishes, pacify them in another way, or rely on the faithful troops.By hovering over the pie chart next to each group of residents, you can see how and why their ideology and questions are changing.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6c_8;Now let's talk about the status of residents.Click on the icon of one of the groups.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6c_9;Upgrading and downgrading;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6c_10;In Victoria II, you don't have to manually change the occupation of the residents.They themselves can choose another profession, if the situation pushes them to do so.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6c_11;Raising and downgrading the status.This is an indicator of the number of people who change their profession.If the environment is favorable, they will try to find a job in their own class or higher.If things go wrong, they will stay in position or sink lower.Hover over a value to see what factors affect a resident.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6c_12;New profession.It shows which professions a conventional citizen is considering, and the points for each of them.Hover over them to get detailed information.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6c_13;The expression 'gradual change' accurately describes the change in the lives of the inhabitants.If you need more inhabitants of a certain type, you must increase the attractiveness of this profession.Plus, you need people who want to change jobs.To better understand this, you can look at information for several groups and find out what factors influence them, and then try to mitigate or amplify those factors.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6c_14;Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6c_15;Migration;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6c_16;Migration to Victoria II follows the same principles as status upgrades.It gradually changes depending on the current situation of the inhabitants.There are three types of migration, each with different driving factors.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6c_17;Internal migration.Internal migration.Residents move to where there is work.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6c_18;External migration.Emigration to other countries.For example, residents move to places where they are more tolerant of their religion.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6c_19;Colonial migration.Migration to and from colonies.Residents want to start a new life in a new place.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_6c_20;Like promotions, these are gradual changes.To understand why the residents are not sitting still, take a closer look at several of your groups of residents.\nClick 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7c_1;Trade;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7c_2;Here we will briefly describe what is new in the game compared to the first 'Victoria', and talk about the role of the state in trade.Let's open the trading screen.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7c_3;Government and trade;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7c_4;In Victoria II, factories and artisans conduct their own trade, and the role of the state is limited to the following.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7c_5;Supply of overseas provinces.To benefit from owning overseas provinces, you must supply them with convoys.Each province that does not have a land link to your capital increases the need for convoys.If you fail to meet this need, the productivity of factories and DPs in this province will decrease.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7c_6;Supply of troops.Your troops need weapons and canned food.If they do not receive the necessary supply, their combat effectiveness drops.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7c_7;Construction.The creation of armies and the construction of factories is impossible without goods.If you build something, the required goods are first taken from your inventory.If something is missing, the missing goods will be included in the needs of the state.The capitalists who build factories buy goods for them at their own expense.You only need to purchase goods for what you manually build.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7c_8;Stocks.States can stockpile goods needed by the population in the event of a blockade.If you check the box 'Buy from stocks', the population of your country will be able to buy goods not only from the markets, but also from your stocks.In this way, the price increases that usually accompany a blockade can be avoided.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7c_9;Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7c_10;GovernmentNeeds and Transaction Management;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7c_11;If your trade is automated, the government's trade orders are exactly the same as its needs.For example, if you create a new army, orders will be given to purchase the goods necessary for this.But sometimes you have to save.In such cases, you can click on any item that the government needs and cancel the automatic trading mode for it.After that, you will be able to regulate transactions for this product yourself.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7c_12;Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7c_13;Markets;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7c_14;Finally, we'll give you a quick look at how the markets work.In Victoria II, all manufactured goods are brought to the market.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7c_15;Common Market.The first stage of trading takes place in the common market.This is the market of a separate country and countries within its sphere of influence (if any).All buyers first try to purchase a product from this market.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7c_16;Export to the world market.Everything that is not sold on the domestic market goes to the world market.The order of purchases is determined by the prestige of the country.Products that are scarce on the market go first to countries with high prestige.What could not be sold on the world market disappears.Manufacturers receive payment only for the product actually sold.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7c_17;In conclusion, we will mention two points that are very important for the stable supply of the country with goods and for stable sales and payment for your products.First, increase your prestige so that your country has priority in procurement.Second, try to provide your home market with the goods necessary for the functioning of your economy.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_7c_18;Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8c_1;Diplomacy;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8c_2;In this section, we'll talk about war and peace and what it means to be a great power.To this end, we switched to the management of a more powerful state - Prussia.Let's open the diplomacy screen.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8c_3;Great powers;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8c_4;Note the eight countries in the upper left corner.These are great powers, and Prussia is one of them.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8c_5;Great power status has a number of advantages: you can pull other countries into your sphere of influence, your minorities are happier, you can create colonies.Loss of status will cause outrage among the people.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8c_6;Powers of the second rank can acquire colonies.Uncivilized states do not begin industrialization without adopting a European way of life.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8c_7;ClickNext to learn how to become a great power.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8c_8;Great Power Status - Acquisition and Loss;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8c_9;Great power status determines a country's score.It is the sum of prestige, military and industrial power.As you can see, our country may well preserve its place in the sun.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
REMOVE_tut_8c_10;If you find yourself in danger of losing your status, you will receive a warning in advance, and you will have time to correct the situation.One of the ways to prevent a catastrophe is, of course, war.It can increase your prestige or lower your opponent's prestige.Find France and declare war on her.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8c_11;Wars and war goals;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
REMOVE_tut_8c_12;In Victoria II, you must define the objectives of any war you start.All possible war targets are shown on the right in the war declaration window.Remember that when making peace, you can only demand what is indicated for the purposes of the war.Let's start a war.Confirm the declaration of war and go to the table of wars.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8c_13;Adding new war targets;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8c_14;You are not limited to just the goals you set when declaring war.If your people are chauvinistic, and you have a high military score (that is, the war is going well), then you can add new goals on this screen.But if you add goals that you cannot achieve, your population will become angry and aggressive.Let's go back to the table of the great powers.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8c_15;Spheres of influence;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8c_16;Small countries can fall into the sphere of influence of great powers.In practice, this means that they will be included in your home market.Expanding your sphere of influence increases the supply of goods to your economy.Another important effect is that when trying to unify a nation, all of your Ancestral provinces must be within your sphere of influence.ClickNext to find out how to pull a country into your sphere of influence.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8c_17;Fight for position;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8c_18;There are two important tools for acquiring a sphere of influence: influence and current opinion.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8c_19;Influence is acquired over time and is distributed among the countries to which you have prioritized using this regulator.We want to unite Germany, and Hanover owns our ancestral lands.Find Hannover in the list of countries and set its priority to maximum by clicking on the corresponding button.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8c_20;Current opinion;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8c_21;"As you can see, Hanover has a neutral opinion of us.If we want to include him in our sphere of influence, we need to change his mind to a friendly one.To do this, there is a diplomatic action called ""Improve Opinion"".Hover over it and you will see that we lack influence.We have already set the highest priority for Hannover, so we just have to wait.";X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8c_22;If other countries try to influence Hanover, we have the means to prevent it.Pay attention to promotions like 'Send an advisor'.They will help us undermine the position of another country.But we cannot take advantage of this promotion until we improve their opinion of us.But there is no need to worry: now only we are interested in Hanover.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_8c_23;As the game progresses, the struggle for influence will intensify.We may even have to use force to pull a country out of someone else's sphere of influence.Let's continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4c_1;Technologies;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4c_2;In this section, we will talk in detail about technologies and technological directions.Let's open the technology screen.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4c_3;Technological directions;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4c_4;On the top panel, you can see several technology directions.These are the paths of technological development along which our technical elite wants to lead the state.In Prussia, the influence of the military-industrial complex prevails.This gives us a bonus to military research at the expense of culture.You can change the technological direction with your decision, but first you must change the direction of your state.As long as military spending remains high, many bright minds will pursue careers in the army.Now let's say a few words about industrial technology.Click on the corresponding button.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4c_5;Industry technology;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4c_6;Industrial technology is leading us along the path of industrialization.These are railways, mines and factories.Please note that many technologies span various industries and increase productivity or reduce the need for raw materials for all factories.Now let's move on to the technologies of culture.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4c_7;Culture technologies;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4c_8;They reflect the level of development of culture and philosophy in our country.National priority and education fall into this category.In addition, your prestige and its growth multiplier largely depend on these technologies.The outstripping development of culture gives numerous advantages, the prestige of the discoverer of sociology will grow significantly.But even if the discovery has already been made, one should not abandon the scientific race: the more states make a discovery of one type, the lower the bonus received by the discoverer will be.Let's move on to commerce.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4c_9;Commerce technology;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4c_10;Commerce technologies are banks, economics, and standardization.If you want to improve the tax system or improve the governance of the country, you need to tackle these technologies.Some of them will come in handy in industry as well.\nAnd now let's move on to the fleet.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4c_11;Fleet technology;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4c_12;Forward and only forward.The ships will get bigger, stronger, faster and get better weapons.In addition, the cruising range of your ships will increase, and you will be able to colonize distant territories.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4c_13;Army technology;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_4c_14;The latest technology for ground forces affects your entire army as a whole.The consumption of supplies, the strength of the attack and the organization depend on them.At the bottom of the list, you will find new weapons: tanks and planes.\nClickNext to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_1;Welcome to 'Victoria II';X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_2;This is an introduction to 'Victoria II' - The Great Strategy Game.The game is mainly set in the 19th century.This was the era of the birth of the modern world, when old empires collapsed and new ones flourished.New technologies have turned the life of peoples and countries upside down, new ideologies have split states, or vice versa, welded them together more than ever before.And all these changes were brought about by the incredible industrial revolution.\nWant to play your part in this era? Click 'Next' to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_3;Your state;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_4;In Victoria II, you will be at the head of the country and lead it through this turbulent time.For this tutorial scenario, we have selected Belgium.This is a good choice to start with - a small country with good potential, as Belgium was already on the road to industrialization by the start of the game.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_4b;In the upper left corner, you see the flag of the selected state and its rank in the world.Raising this rank is one of the important tasks in the game.\nClickNext to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_5;State administration;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_6;In Victoria II, you have a set of tools to influence the fate of the state.Many of them act indirectly: you change laws and taxes and after a while you observe the result of your actions.You have eight screens to manage, which are opened by tabs on the top bar.At the top, you can also get important information about your country.\nHere are the eight screens.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_7;Production.It contains information about industry and the production of goods - the engine of the economy in the process of industrialization.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_8;Budget.Money makes the world go round, and so does Victoria II.This is where you manage your taxes and expenses.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_10;Technologies.This is where you research new technologies.Each technology you learn will help you fight for your position on the world stage.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_11;Politics.This is one of the cornerstones of the game.Through the political system, you run the state, carry out reforms and support political parties.Try not to overload the interests of various groups in society with your policies.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_12;Population.The people who inhabit your country are the main concern of Victoria II.You will have to make many decisions with an eye to the opinion of the people, because it is on people that their immediate and long-term consequences will be reflected.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_13;Trade.Goods that are produced in an industrial (and pre-industrial) society must be exchanged for money.This happens during the trading process.Trade in Victoria II takes place without your intervention, but you will have to buy the goods the government needs and monitor changes in the market, because they may affect your country.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_14;Diplomacy.Another pillar of 'Victoria II'.The formation of alliances and the struggle for control over small states play a large role in winning a place in the sun.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_15;Army.Finally, the art of war.Politics and diplomacy have their limits beyond which the guns must speak.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_16;Map;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_17;Most of the game action takes place on the world map.Here you see countries, buildings and troops.You can move the map by moving the cursor to the edge, and change its scale with the scroll wheel of the mouse.Try this, then clickNext to continue.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;

tut_0a_22;Map types;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_23;To help you understand the world we live in, there are several types of map in the game.Now we are looking at a map of the area, but we can switch to a political map in order to better see which provinces belong to different states.Do it.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_24;The passage of time;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_25;The game is currently paused.When the game is paused, you can give orders and control all aspects of the game.When you are done with the orders and orders, release the pause to start the course of events.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_26;The current date is January 1, 1836.Next to the date, there is a pause icon and plus and minus signs.Pressing pause will start the course of time, and with the plus and minus you can adjust the speed of the playing time.The space bar also turns pause on and off.Now try to unpause.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_27;Developments;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_28;Various events will take place in the world.Some of them affect you, others do not.There are several ways to find out what is going on:;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_29;Popup windows.They appear in the center of the screen, these are important events.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_30;Message icons.These messages may be of interest to you, but do not always require immediate attention.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_31;The event log.Here you can read everything else - not too important, but interesting.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_32;Diplomatic badges.It is important.They represent all diplomatic offers that you receive from other states.To view and respond to them, left-click on them.If you want to reject them without consideration, right-click.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
tut_0a_33;You can adjust the appearance of all messages except diplomatic.Perhaps a change of ruler in another state deserves a pop-up window.To do this, right-click on the message or select the view in the message settings menu.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;

REMOVE_GC_DESC;Dust settled in the fields of Waterloo, where the ideals of the French Revolution seemed to have ended at the hands of the old European regimes.In the wake of the disasters of theNapoleonic Wars, decisions made at the Congress of Vienna restored fragile tranquility on the troubled continent.Although the flames of the revolution have been temporarily extinguished, it will soon become clear that the ideas of civil liberties, nationalism and liberalism are more alive than ever before.In America, these same ideas threaten to plunge the young republic into a devastating civil war.Princess Victoria is 16 years old and will soon ascend to the throne of Great Britain, the greatest industrial empire that has ever sprung up in the world.Her ascension to the throne will mark the beginning of a long and successful reign and herald the beginning of an era that will last until the First World War.In this new era of unprecedented technological progress, beliefs that have been unshakable since time immemorial will be called into question, and new dogmas will take their place.From afar, because of the seas and oceans, the riches of Asia and Africa beckon, the melodies of which can also be heard in the European concert.Maestro, choose your instrument and let the music play!;X;X;X;X;X;X;;

EVTDESC44117;At the beginning of the 19th century, numerous sects emerged within the Protestant branch of Christianity in the United States, and this created an environment for in-depth study of theology.One of the most influential currents that emerged as a result was American Unitarianism.It emphasized the role of reason in understanding theology (and thus the denial of the idea of ??the Holy Trinity), on the innate virtues of humanity and, as a result, on its ability to improve itself.Unitarianism has become widespread among the middle and upper classes in the northeastern United States and has spawned some movements for social progress - from popular education to abolitionism.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;

nihilism_and_the_will_desc;The tendencies that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to abandon rationalistic explanations of human nature were caused by a revived interest in nihilism.Some philosophers have rejected the idea that human life has any higher meaning, given by God orNature.A person ceased to be considered as a value in itself, his Will came to the fore - the ability to intervene in events and achieve his goals.The most prominent representative of this trend of philosophical thought at the end of the 19th century was FriedrichNietzsche.The dire consequences of the wars of the industrial era in the early twentieth century strongly influenced other philosophers (for example, Martin Heidegger) and prompted them to develop the ideas ofNietzsche.Nihilism rejected absolute values ??as the basis of human behavior and, therefore, questioned the values ??and beliefs prevailing in the 19th century, and some of them were simply discarded.At the same time, the absolutization of Will encouraged criticism in relation to generally accepted norms and principles, as well as the search and creation of new ones.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;

the_revolt_of_the_masses_desc;The spread of the principle of universal suffrage as the basis for resolving the issue of political power in society led to increased hopes for democracy as a means of satisfying the age-old aspirations of the common people.The growth in the number of small political parties soon marked the limit after which the system of liberal democracy ceased to fulfill its main purpose - to extinguish conflicts in society.The situation was especially aggravated during periods of economic and political crises.Disappointment with the ideals of democracy and hopes for a better life led to the search for alternative ways of organizing the political system.In 1930, the Spanish philosopher Jos? Ortega y Gasset wrote the book The Rise of the Masses.He warned of the growing danger to the ideals of liberal democracy that came from the masses, capable of overturning the political system and replacing it with such forms of social order that would destroy the very foundations of the existence of liberal democracy.According to the philosopher, this could be avoided only if democracy itself adapts to the conditions of the era of active participation of the masses in politics.;X;X;X;X;X;X;;

FAQstart1;First of all, you need to get the minimum number of priests in the country (2%), which gives the maximum number of research points (RP) for this, put national priorities on priests and study ideologemes.After ideologems, it is worth studying medicine, as it will give you a large population growth;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
FAQstart2;Next, pay attention to your budget, it would be best to put the maintenance of priests and officials at 100%, duties are also maximum, taxes on the population too, but over time, reduce taxes for all groups of the population.If you have a combat fleet, then if you do not need it in the next 5 years, it should be disbanded (do not disband transport ships);X;X;X;X;X;X;;
FAQstart3;Try to capture as many colonies as possible, but be careful not to cross the road to powers that may threaten you.After ideologems and medicine, you should strengthen your position in 3 ways: 1 tech and commerce and industry (for non-belligerent and more or less literate countries), 2 cultural tech (for illiterate countries), 3 military tech (for countries that start to fight early);X;X;X;X;X;X;;
FAQbase1;The main mechanic of the game, and accordingly the most important one is the population, try to increase its growth in all possible ways: reducing emigration and increasing immigration, technologies for population growth, medical reforms, the seizure of territories;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
FAQbase2;Research points (RP) will help you to get ahead, which means to strengthen your position on the world stage, increase due to: literacy, pluralism, priests, culture technologies 2 columns, clerks, position on the world stage (great powers get more), the seizure of territories ( only for non-civilians), as well as with the help of individual solutions and events;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
FAQbase3;"China can be captured only after its unification (about 60 years and after) and in one region (bordering with you or coastal) The main colonization begins in 70 after the invention of ""colonial relations"" and goes through your colonial power, which can be increased from assistance: higher-level ports, ships, selected maritime technologies";X;X;X;X;X;X;;
FAQprom1;At the beginning of the game, forget about the capitalists - they are still useless, you should accept the party with state capitalism and build the industry yourself.Only after your industry gets stronger, and resources continue to increase, you can move to a market economy with a free market, where you will receive more benefits from taxes, and not from duties.There are 2 theories of building factories: 1) Resource: build factories in regions that have resources that these factories consume to get a bonus to production, 2) Commodity: build factories that your country can provide with resources.Depending on your playstyle and country, you will have to balance these 2 theories;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
FAQprom2;Employees begin to appear normally after reaching 50% literacy in the country.Do not forget to build a military industrial, since at the beginning of a war, your industry may not be enough to provide an army, while this sector is extremely resource-intensive, so you should increase the number of iron mines and coal mines available to you.Taxes and duties are the backbone of any economy, you should increase their size by increasing the population, industrial and commercial technologies, adjusting sliders, capturing colonies and regions, as well as improving industry and gradually enriching your population;X;X;X;X;X;X;;
